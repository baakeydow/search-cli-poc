● The rank score must be 100% if a file contains all the words
● It must be 0% if it contains none of the words
● It should be between 0 and 100 if it contains only some of the words, but the exact ranking
formula is up 2 you to choose and implement
Expectations (please read carefully)
● The program must run and return results on search queries
● The code must include unit tests and be well structured to support future maintenance and
evolutions. ​Try to use the best practices that you have learned from your past experiences
● You should be spending 2-3 hours on the task, but approaching 'production like' quality is more
important than implementation speed and feature completeness
● External libraries are forbidden, other than test/mocking frameworks
● A build procedure whenever applicable (compiled language)
Things to consider in your implementation
● Ranking score design — ​start with something basic​, then iterate as time allows
● The in memory representation — searches should be relatively efficient
● What constitutes a word ?
● What constitutes two words being equal (and matching) ?
● You will be discussing your code in the next stage of the interview process with our engineers,
so keep in mind how your code can be iterated on, how it can be maintained and what features
could be added later
